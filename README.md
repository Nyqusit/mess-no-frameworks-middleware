# mess-no-frameworks-middleware
A simple messaging app built with node js. No frameworks or middleware are used

I decided to use my ipv4 address for the ip so I could open it on multiple computers at my residence so you will need to change 
"10.0.0.114" in the listen function to your ipv4 adress or 127.0.0.1.

You will need launch the js file with node.js to run this app.
